          Representing SHO Coffee & Bar
        </h2>
        <p className="font-[300] text-[16px] md:text-[20px]">
          When you are in your uniform, you are representing our company- inside
          the store, when you are outside, or when you are on social media. In
          uniform, you are expected to act and speak with the same level of
          professionalism both on and off the floor. If you are eating food from
          other stores, you must be in the office. Smoking and vaping must be
          done out the back door and without your uniform logo visible.
        </p>
        <p className="font-[300] text-[16px] md:text-[20px]">
          On the floor, all conversation must be appropriate. If someone is
          making you uncomfortable, inform your shift lead immediately.

          Shift Punctuality
        </h2>
        <p className="font-[300] text-[16px] md:text-[20px]">
          Sho Coffee & Bar requires all employees to arrive five to ten minutes
          before the start of their shifts. If you are unable to arrive at the
          expected time, you are responsible to inform the shift lead (by phone
          or text) as soon as you know you will be late. All late instances will
          be recorded by your shift leads. Repeated tardiness may lead to write
          ups, shift reductions, or termination.
          <br /> When arriving to your shift, do not clock in until you are
          fully ready to begin your work. You may not clock in early unless
          requested by your shift lead.
        </p>

          On-Call Shifts
        </h2>
        <p className="font-[300] text-[16px] md:text-[20px]">
          On-call shifts are required by Sho Coffee & Bar. You are expected to
          come within an hour of being called, or at the start time of the shift
          you are covering. You do not have to come in if it is past the end of
          your on-call shift. (ex: you’re scheduled 8-4, after 4 you do not need
          to answer) <br /> Failure to answer the call, and/or failure to arrive
          to the shift will lead to write ups, shift reduction, or termination.
          Any time you are called in, you receive a free meal (up to $16) in
          thanks for helping the floor!

          Calling in Sick
        </h2>
        <p className="font-[300] text-[16px] md:text-[20px]">
          When you are not feeling able to work, especially when you are ill
          with something contagious, we fully encourage you to stay home or get
          the medical attention you need. We will welcome you back whenever you
          are fit to work again. <br /> When you are ill, it is your
          responsibility to contact your shift lead. We expect a minimum of
          three hours notice, but as soon as possible is ideal. If you know if
          you will be needing more time to recover, let us know so we can plan
          accordingly. <br /> Calling in sick multiple times over a short period
          may result in loss of shifts or termination. Any personal emergency
          will follow the same procedures.

          <li>
            If you swap to an on-call shift, the on-call policy will be
            enforced, and you must answer. o If you are confused who to ask,
            your shift leads can help you find who may be available

          While we always try our best to fulfill all requests, there isn’t a
          guarantee that you will receive the time off. Time off requests must
          be made at least two weeks in advance. We prefer you also include a
          reason for the time off, so we can prioritize time off requests if
          there are multiple for the same day(s). <br /> We expect you to be
          able to work all holidays (excluding the days we will not be open).
          Requests can be made, but certain holidays will be approved based on
          specific staff needs <br /> (ex: those with children will be
          prioritized for Halloween). <br />
          Weekend requests can be made, but you will not be getting all weekend
          requests approved. Employee needs will be considered when making the
